# Optimization-using-Evolutionary-and-Mathematical-Techniques

This repo consists of Implementations of Evolutionary Methods and Mathematical Methods to solve single objective optimization benchmark problems and 2 constrained Mechanical Design Problems. 
We used Marquartz Method coupled with Single direction Golden Search method to arrive at the Global Optimal Solution. We use Bracket-Penalty function to penalize Constraint Violation. Refer to attached report regarding the details.
We implemented the following Evolutionary Algorithms: TLBO, PSO, and used external implementations for DE and ACO.
