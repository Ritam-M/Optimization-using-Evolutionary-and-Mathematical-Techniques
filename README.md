# Optimization-using-Evolutionary-and-Mathematical-Techniques

This repo consists of Implementations of Evolutionary Methods and Mathematical Methods to solve single objective optimization benchmark problems and 2 constrained Mechanical Design Problems. 
We used Marquartz Method coupled with Single direction Golden Search method to arrive at the Global Optimal Solution. We use Bracket-Penalty function to penalize Constraint Violation. Refer to attached report regarding the details.
We implemented the following Evolutionary Algorithms: TLBO, PSO, and used external implementations for DE and ACO.


Additional results for the following Algorithms will be updated soon:
1. Mine Blast Algorithm, Ray Algorithm
2. TLBO-PSO: A hybrid algorithm to overcome the drawbacks of TLBO where Teacher learning is same as the mean of the population.
3. Artificial Bee Colony.
4. Sea-Lion Algorithm.
